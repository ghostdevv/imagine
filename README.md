Dynamically generate and cache spongebob imagine gifs on the edge (blazingly fast ‚ö°Ô∏è)

The text you want to display is the filename of the gif. It supports percent encoded URLs, additionally treating and `_`s as spaces. It'll attempt to clean your input, and redirect you to the updated URL if it does. Emojis currently don't work yet, and line wrapping is not supported.

For example:

```
